## What is it about?

A computer vision powered calorie counter - Made as part of CSCI-480 Agile Software Development and DevOps

With heart disease and other related health conditions on the rise, people are becoming more mindful of what they eat, so it is not uncommon to see people counting their calories at each meal. However, most apps today are quite tedious to use since you often have to manually enter each individual item and its appropriate calorie value. This is quite cumbersome to do since you would have to know the appropriate calorie values. This project aims to provide another solution to calorie counting through the use of computer vision. Instead of the user manually entering the values, they take a picture of the food instead and the app calculates an approximate value for the number of calories and adds it to their daily counter. The user could then view trends in their calorie consumption through useful analytics such as amount of protein consumed, etc on the app.

This app would greatly help people to be more mindful of what they eat, as well as give them helpful analytics of how they could improve their eating habits. The app will be used by a wide array of people from the general public, basically anyone who wishes to keep track of what they are eating. And, this is especially useful to college students since they tend to have unhealthy eating habits due to busy schedules. The creation of this app would be quite feasible over the course of the semester since there are existing technologies and databases out there that would help with some of the heavier tasks such as recognizing food items, as well as retrieving nutritional information. However, the harder task would be designing a seamless integration of all these components, while creating an intuitive to understand interface to the end-users.
